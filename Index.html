        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We provide services for individuals who wish for Hajj or Umrah to be performed on behalf of their
            dead relatives or those who are too old and weak to perform the pilgrimage personally, to pay to
            get the pilgrimage done on their behalf. We also provide services such as flight bookings, hotel
            bookings, and personalized tour guidance for people who wish to explore the two holy cities of
            Makkah and Medinah and the entirety of The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Visit historic sites such as
            Badr, Uhud, The Cave of Hira, and many more.
